 Description: When the Infinite Peripherals SDK calls `connectionState`
 on its delegate, it passes back a 0, 1, or 2. We attempt to instantiate a
 `IPConnectionState` to verify that a valid value was returned.
 
 An `IPConnectionState` instance also knows how to pretty print its value
 by using the `toString` method.
